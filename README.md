This repository contains code used for the paper
["Efficient calculation of self magnetic field, self-force, and self-inductance
for electromagnetic coils. II. Rectangular cross-section"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12087),
by M Landreman, S Hurwitz, and T M Antonsen Jr.
It provides an efficient method to compute the magnetic field inside a conductor
as well as the self-inductance and the Lorentz force associated with this
self-field.
